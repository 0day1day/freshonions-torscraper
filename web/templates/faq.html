				What do the colours of the onion links mean?
			</td>
			<td class="answer">
				Green means the site is live. Orange means we've been having some trouble connecting to it recently, but it may still be fine. Red means we haven't been able to connect to it for over four hours, and the link is likely to be dead.

			<td class="question">
				How often are the links checked?
			</td>
			<td class="answer">
				Sites that are up get checked every 1-4 hours. Sites that are dead get checked (60+rand(180))*(1.5^dead_in_a_row) where "dead_in_a_row" is the number of times this site has been checked and been found dead in a row. If a site is found to be up this is reset to zero.

			<td class="question">
				Where do you get new onions from?
			</td>
			<td class="answer">
				This site runs a tor web spider that is constantly crawling every link in the database 24/7. New links are added as they are discovered.

				What do the [F] and [G] tags mean?
			</td>
			<td class="answer">
				Sites listed in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darknetmarkets/wiki/superlist">/r/darknetmarkets superlist</a> are tagged as [G]enuine. Clones of these sites are tagged as [F]ake. Note that clone detection is pretty primitive.

				Sure thing! I run this site as a public service, so will try to help if I can. Hit me up on reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/abruptdismissal/">abruptdismissal</a>.
